## Installation

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/oyl-wallet/oyl-sdk.git
$ cd oyl-sdk
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- yarn

### Running the tests

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Using the CLI version

```sh
$ make reset
```

This does a fresh build of the lib directory which the cli uses after all the .ts files are compiled.

The name of the bin for the cli is called "oyl". If you want to invoke it without having the yarn prefix you need to add it globally.
Run this command:

```sh
$ yarn global add oyl
```

You can also link the package so it updates as you make local changes:

```sh
$ yarn link
```

If you want the program to be isolated to only this enviornment use the local script provided to you like this:

```sh
$ yarn oyl --help
```

e.g. `oyl utxos addressUtxos -a bcrt1qcr8te4kr609gcawutmrza0j4xv80jy8zeqchgx -p regtest`.
For more detailed instructions on how to use the cli, refer to the README.md found in the cli directory.
